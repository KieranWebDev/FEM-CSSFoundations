            <p class="name">Hi, my name is <span>Bob The Builder</span></p>
            <h2 class="sub-title">I Build stuff</h2>

            <p>I'm an builder with over 30 years of experience. I used to have my own TV show and was very popular in
                the
                90's.
            </p>

            <p> Currently, I've resorted to accepting any reality TV gigs I can get as I struggle to remain significant
                in
                the
                public eye.</p>
            <p>I can fix anything made in the analogue era. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BobtheBuilder/"

                    <p class="black-box">Originally I wanted to call it Big Bob, but the local authorities wouldn’t have
                        it. It's a big tower that tells the time really well. What else is there to say? We also built
                        it to make loud, annoying noices every 15 minutes in order to really annoy the people who work
                        and live near it.

                        had lying around the warehouse. We were originally making a large model of a UFO but Birmingham
                        council said they wanted to buy it and turn it into a shopping mall.

                        blueprints. We managed to wing it as a feature and the clients bought into it. We made a mint on
                        this one! The lads and I had an ace time in Vegas afterwards. It turned out well as people still
                        love it.
